            Cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been
             confirmed positive according to official protocols.As of 23 March, no country had tested 
             more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test 
             those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
              A study published on 16 March found that in China, up to 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 
             infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% 
             of documented cases. A statistical analysis published 30 March estimated that numbers of infections 
             in Italy were considerably greater than the reported cases. The initial estimates of the basic 
             reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4. A study published by the US Center for
              Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it may be 5.7.
