        <p>The COVID-19 virus affects different people in different ways.  COVID-19 is a respiratory disease 
            and most infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring 
            special treatment.  People who have underlying medical conditions and those over 60 years old 
            have a higher risk of developing severe disease and death.</p>
            Common symptoms include:
            <ol>
                <li>fever</li>
                <li>tiredness</li>
                <li>dry cough</li>
                Other symptoms include:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>aches and pains</li>
                    <li>sore throat</li>
                    <li>runny nose abd diarrhoea</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>            
            <p>
                People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should self-isolate and contact their 
                medical provider or a COVID-19 information line for advice on testing and referral. <br>
                People with fever, cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor 
                and seek medical attention.

                Using available preliminary data, the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission published on
                 Feb. 28 by WHO, [5] which is based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases, observed the following 
                 median time from symptoms onset to clinical recovery:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mild cases: approximately 2 weeks</li>
                    <li>Severe or critical disease: 3 - 6 weeks</li>
                    <li>Time from onset to the development of severe disease (including hypoxia): 1 week</li>
                </ul>
                Among patients who have died, the time from symptom onset to outcome ranges from 2 - 8 weeks.
